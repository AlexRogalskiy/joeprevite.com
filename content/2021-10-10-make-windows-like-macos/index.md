I've been using macOS as my main driver for the past 10 years or so. Last month, I bought a PC.

Since I now switch between macOS and Windows daily - mac for work and Windows for personal - I wanted to find a way to synchronize my workflow, specifically:

- applications
- keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys)

## Overview

This guide assumes you prefer the keyboard shortcuts and applications on macOS and you want them to be similar on Windows 10.

### Applications

Here are a list of applications on macOS and their equivalent on Windows. You'll need to install the Windwos ones if you don't already have them:

- [Rocket](http://www.get-emoji.com/rocket/) -> Windows Emoji Picker (built-in with Windows 10)
  - used to quickly type emojis
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) -> Windows Shortcut Menu (built-in with Windows 10) \*not sure if this is the correct name
  - used to quickly open apps, or change computer state (sleep, restart, shutdown)
- macOS Screenshot Tool -> Windows Snipping Tool (built-in)
  - used to take screenshots
- [Clippy](https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy) -> Windows Clipboard
  - manages your clipboard history
- N/A -> [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys)
  - comes with a Keyboard Manager and many other tools

### Keyboard Shortcuts



### Additional Notes

There are some limitations to this. For instance, connecting to bluetooth devices on macOS is only two clicks vs four clicks on Windows. I also couldn't make the Windows Emoji Picker exactly like Rocket.

Sometimes the keyboard manager in PowerToys doesn't work and I have to restart my PC.

Other times, putting my PC to sleep and waking it back up, applications randomly stop working.
