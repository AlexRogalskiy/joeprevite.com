Hey, let's talk about learning Vim.

Most resources that you pay for come in two categories:
1. video courses
2. books

But there's a huge problem with both. **They're passive.**

Either you sit in front of the screen watching someone else explain a concept or you flip through pages as you read. Both work well for helping you understand something new and complex, like Vim. 

But there's a catch. **You're not really learning.**

The real learning of Vim happens in the editor. You already know and love VSCode. Why not *supercharge* it with Vim?

That's where **Vim for VSCode** comes in. For only $10, you get:
- 100+ exercises
- 22 commands
- 5 exercises per command
- Hands-on learning

Sure, you can learn Vim for free with `vimtutor` and then transfer that knowledge to be used with Vim in VSCode. But here's why that *isn't* the best way to learn:
- it's a different environment
- it only has 1 exercise per command
- it covers the bare minimum

You can certainly do it. I did it. But it's *slow and inefficient*.

**Vim for VSCode** takes a new approach. 

One that uses techniques *backed by science*.
