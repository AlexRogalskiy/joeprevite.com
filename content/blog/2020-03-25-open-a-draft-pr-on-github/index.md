I don't think this feature been out for too long. It's handy when you want to open a PR to show your teammates you're making progress before you're ready for a formal review.

To do this,

1. Open a new pull request via GitHub in the browser
2. Scroll down to the "Create pull request" button
3. Click the dropdown arrow next to the button
4. Select "Create draft pull request"

Easy as that! It also prevents anyone from merging your PR accidentally. You have to mark it as ready before it can be merged.

Woohoo! Enjoy!
