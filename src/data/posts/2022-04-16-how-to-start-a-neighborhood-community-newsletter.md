The other day a friend told me about his neighborhood community newsletter that he gets every week. It lists events happening in the neighborhood for that month. People host things like coffee in their frontyard, cocktail mixhours, neighborhood clean up events and more. It's really cool.

I reached out to the group who runs it and they shared a lot of useful information on how to start your own.

## Examples

The one my friend lives in is near Encanto Park in Phoenix and is called Fairview Place Neighborhood Association. There's another one called Willo which is a historical neighborhood and they produce a digital monthly newsletter. They have their own [website](https://willophx.com/willo-residents/inside-willo/).

## Resources

Here's a list of resources they shared for starting your own:
- [Phoenix Neighborhood Block Watch Grants](https://www.phoenix.gov/police/resources-information/block-watch-grants)
- [Phoenix Neighborhood List](https://nsdonline.phoenix.gov/NeighborhoodOrgs/Alphabetical)
- [Scottsdale APS Community Grants](https://www.aps.com/en/About/Community/In-the-Community/In-kind-Contributions)
- [Scottsdale Neighborhood List](https://www.scottsdaleaz.gov/citizen-service/neighborhood-notification)

Hope this information helps you start your own neighborhood community newsletter!
