1. Go to **System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts**
2. Click on **Screenshots**
3. Change "Copy picture of selection area to the clipboard" to <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>
4. Change "Save picture of selected area as a file" to <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

That's it! Now, you can easily take screenshots and share them in things like PR comments or tweets by pasting them from your clipboard.
